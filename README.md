Defend your space ship with Gizmoids! Built with Unity Engine. Tower defense with a twist! Intended for mobile platforms.

This game was original conceptualized as a Flash game in 2013 inspired by other tower defense game of that era. The project was then reimagined for mobile written in C# using the Unity Engine. Many talented developers, designers, artist and creators worked on the mobile version. Gizmoidz did receive an iOS release but produciton was rushed. Due to numerous constraints the game never got the chance it deserved.

Instead of letting this project die and join the pile of adandonware games, I overhauled the code base to give the game a second chance. Now the game is more performent and scalable than ever before. A playable web version of the game be found here http://www.gizmoids.tom-wilhelm.com

I hope you enjoy the game!
